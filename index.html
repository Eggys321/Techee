                I came into Tech Studio Academy with practically no prior
                knowledge in software development. However, within a few weeks,
                I was able to grasp the crux of software development and also
                master the soft skills required for being a software developer.
                <br />
                <br />
                So far so good, the skills acquired have given me a mind-blowing
                push in my career as a software developer.

              Tech Studio Academy has been one of the big push I needed to get
              in the real world space. I had an immense learning that was really
              different from the self learning I started with. The learning was
              fun and there were some internship job opportunities that were
              presented to us. I got my first gig immediately after the program.
            </p>

            <p>Thank you Tech Studio for that push I needed.</p>

                I bless the day the Instagram algorithm pop up Tech Studio
                Academy to my news feed. I read through their curriculum and
                other details about the Bootcamp and I told myself this is the
