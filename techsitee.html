            I came into Tech Studio Academy with practically no prior knowledge
            in software development. However, within a few weeks, I was able to
            grasp the crux of software development and also master the soft
            skills required for being a software developer. So far so good, the
            skills acquired have given me a mind-blowing push in my career as a
            software developer. <br />

            Tech Studio Academy has been one of the big push I needed to get in
            the real world space. I had an immense learning that was really
            different from the self learning I started with. The learning was
            fun and there were some internship job opportunities that were
            presented to us. I got my first gig immediately after the program.
            Thank you Tech Studio for that push I needed. <br /><br />

          I bless the day the Instagram algorithm pop up Tech Studio Academy to
          my news feed. I read through their curriculum and other details about
          the Bootcamp and I told myself this is the opportunity I've been
          waiting for. I wasn't disappointed, the environment was well
          ventilated and conducive, with competent instructors. Here I am today
          at OT&T Consulting, fulfilling my dreams thanks to Tech Studio
          Academy.
